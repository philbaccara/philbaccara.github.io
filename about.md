I'm a French Full-Stack Developer for who to play on his guitar thinking about what he will develop next or listen to music by programming is his definition of Nirvana !

I learned the web development at university with <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" class="bold yellow animated" target="\_blank">javascript</a> and <a href="https://secure.php.net/" class="bold blue animated" target="\_blank">php</a> that I used a lot for work. After a while, I met the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" class="bold red animated" target="\_blank">Ruby</a> language and his incredible framework <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" class="bold red animated" target="\_blank">Ruby On Rails</a> which opened me the doors of a marvelous world of syntactic sugar, purely <i>object-oriented programming</i> and amazing creation tools.

During my musical career, I continued to develop some websites and applications as a freelance/hobbyist programmer and finally compile my both passions in one BIG project during the last year using <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/" class="bold violet animated" target="\_blank">Elixir</a> and its blazingly fast framework <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/" class="bold orange animated" target="\_blank">Phoenix</a> coupled to <a href="http://elm-lang.org/" class="bold cyan animated" target="\_blank">Elm</a> which allowed me to initiate myself to the <i>functionnal programming</i>.

<p class="notice--epices">
  I'm currently working for the employer group called <span style="font-weight: bold; color">G.E.D.E.R.R.A.</span> and more particularly for the S.A.S. <a href="https://www.epices-energie.fr" class="bold animated" target="_blank">Épices-énergie</a> and the association <a href="http://www.hespul.org/" class="bold animated" target="\_blank">HESPUL</a> as a <strong>Full-Stack Lead Developer</strong>.
